## Deadline 1 - TUE 2020-12-01 (Dec 01)

1. Have decided on which game I am going to make, and that will be Tetris.
2. I plan to complete an outline of what I am going to do, complete the title screen and extra buttons, and start on the main portion before the next deadline.
3. For the features I will use branching for, are keeping track of the levels and maybe the title screen. Not 100% sure yet though.

## Deadline 2 - TUE 2020-12-08 (Dec 08)

1. I have created a seperate Tetris class that handles the functionality of some of the block. Also have created the main instance variables that I will use.
2. I plan to complete the rest of the design before the next deadline and implement the keyboard controls and main menu
3. I just have had to figure out how to use the rectangle class which took me a long time to figure out. Nothing major yet, however.
